⚙️ My academic and technical interests lie primarily in embedded hardware design, control systems, and intelligent mechatronic platforms. I focus on developing efficient and reliable hardware architectures for automation, robotics, and industrial IoT applications.

🔩 My work spans from microcontroller-based development using STM32 to integrated solutions on Single Board Computers(SBC) like Raspberry Pi and NVIDIA Jetson, emphasizing real-time performance, system stability, and scalability across various embedded environments.

🔋 I am particularly passionate about hardware–software co-design, sensor integration, and power-efficient architectures for autonomous and connected systems. My recent projects involve remote content delivery networks for multi-display systems, custom UAV and VTOL control hardware, and IoT-based automation nodes for intelligent infrastructure.
