The **Naiza Boxer** project is a commercial arcade punching machine developed at Jaqsy IT, designed from the ground up to combine mechanical engineering, embedded electronics, and software integration into a robust entertainment system deployed across Kazakhstan.  

The system measures punching force, plays synchronized animations, handles multi-channel payments, and provides a seamless user experience through a modular embedded architecture.

### Highlights

- **Custom Embedded Hardware:**  
  Designed two dedicated PCBs — a main control board and a display module — with EMI protection, optically isolated inputs, and robust power handling for high-current solenoids and LED matrices.

- **ESP8266 Firmware (C++):**  
  Implemented event-driven, non-blocking firmware architecture for real-time responsiveness using interrupts and timers, ensuring reliable operation under continuous commercial use.

- **Multi-Payment Integration:**  
  Supported coin acceptors, bill validators, and QR-based payments via local banks. Implemented secure logic for transaction concurrency and fault recovery.

- **Visual & Audio Synchronization:**  
  Developed WS2812B LED matrix animations and DFPlayer Mini-based audio playback to provide real-time feedback synced with impact sensing events.

- **System Reliability:**  
  Applied hardware abstraction, ISR-based event handling, and modular firmware design, achieving excellent uptime and field performance.
